<H1>Thinking About Becoming a Technical Sales Engineer?  The Basics</H1>

<P>
This is my second installment of "Thinking About Becoming a Sales Engineer".  
Part 2 is a continuation of the Basics.  In this piece, I want to cover the 
steps in the sales process.  Most Sales People consider eight basic steps in 
the sales process.  These steps are:

A very difficult and important part of the sales process is Identification.  
You can break down a customer visit into several segments.  These sectors are:  
Industry, Technology, Company, Division, Group, Personnel, Projects, 
Products of Interest and Location.  When venturing out on a sales call, 
you need to decide where your time is best served.  In my case, I cover a 
variety of products, spanning many technologies and applications in the 
Metro area.  I can plan my day by concentration on a particular Industry, 
such as Communications; a particular Technology, such as Wireless; 
a particular company, such as Nokia; and a particular Division and Group, 
such as Wireless Research.  Then, I can target the individuals in that Group, 
located in a particular location, such as Murray Hill.  Before I set up an 
appointment, I should check the Nokia web site to check for new Projects.  
I can then match all the aforementioned parameters to the Products I can 
provide.  This process helps ensure a beneficial meeting for the customer 
and for me.  I have put together a strategy and I am prepared.

The next step involves the Meeting.  Most Sales Engineers know that this is a 
frustrating part of the sales process.  You may find that your customers do 
not respond to phone calls, e-mails or texts.  In a later section of my 
tutorial, I will address techniques which could help you maximize the 
effectiveness of contacting potential customers.  Overall, you must figure 
out a way to be persistent without being a pest.

Once you meet the customer, you need to quickly assess if you are spending 
your time wisely.  A key skill of a good Sales Engineer is to Qualify the 
potential customer.  Do they have a Technical Need that you can satisfy, 
and are they Funded?  The answer to these two questions will determine whether 
or not to move forward.  Note, that in my opinion, a customer visit is never a 
waste of time.  Any customer visit establishes rapport between you and your 
customers.  This is a key element to sales.  If your customer does not have 
a current need and/or is not funded, you may not have an immediate sales potential, 
but you have started to establish a relationship for future opportunities.

A key part of sales is developing relationships.  Hopefully, you are in business 
for the long haul.  Although, you would like to generate immediate sales 
opportunities, it is always important to establish relationships for future sales 
opportunities.  In a later tutorial, I plan to also discuss how to spread your
wings in an account.  In other words, how can you find other opportunities 
within an account when you currently only have a limited number of contacts.

<P> In the next installment, we will discover the subsequent aspects of the sales 
process.  When a potential customer is positively Qualified, what do you do next?
