<H1>Thinking About Becoming a Technical Sales Engineer?  The Basics</H1>

<P>
Hi all.  I hope you all remember me.  I was the IEEE North Jersey Section 
Chair in 2013 and 2014.  I am still involved in the IEEE North Jersey Section; 
active with several Societies, Affinity Groups and Committees.  What you may 
not know is that I have been a Sales Engineer for about 25 years.  Prior to 
that, I held positions in Design and Test Engineering.

Several years ago, I was asked to give presentations to various IEEE Societies.  
These presentations were focused on the skills needed to be effective in 
sales in a technical environment.  I was recently asked to periodically express 
some of my thoughts related to Sales Engineering in the IEEE North Jersey 
Newsletter.  Well, this is my first installment.
</P>

Let's start at the beginning, with the basics.  As an effective Sales Engineer, 
you must be confident.  In technical sales, you must think of yourself as a 
consultant, not an order taker.  Your customers must look at you as a source 
of useful information.  There is a wealth of information on the internet.  Why 
are you needed, unless you can offer something more than the internet?  That 
something more is your breath of knowledge and experience related to the 
products and services you sell and to the customer's applications.  Therefore, 
you must have a good understanding of the products and services your offer.  
Additionally, you need to have an understanding of your customers.  With your 
knowledge and understanding, you can speak with authority.  In other words, 
you are confident.  Your customers will not only respect you for your confidence; 
they will trust you.  You are gaining their trust, because you are showing that 
you are a valuable asset, with whom they can rely on for information and support.

How do you gain confidence?  You must be prepared.  Regarding your products 
and services, I refer to "The Elevator Speech".  If you were in an elevator 
with your customer, and you only had about 30 seconds to talk about your 
offerings, what important points should you highlight?  You need to develop 
an Elevator Speech for all your key products.  Focus on a few key features, 
and emphasize their benefits.  Limit this to about three points, and no more.  
Try to be prepared for questions your customers may ask.  Answer with 
confidence.  If you do not know an answer, tell your customer that you will 
find out the answer.  Never guess or make up an answer that sounds good.  
Your customers need to trust you.  They will understand that you cannot have 
answers for all their questions.  However, make sure you can provide a correct, 
detailed answer swiftly.

With confidence comes a comfort level.  Sales can be stressful, but it 
should be enjoyable.   My view on sales is: "Where else can I get paid to 
hang out with my friends?".
</P>

<P> So, practice, be confident and enjoy yourself.  See you in the next installment. </P>
