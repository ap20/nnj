<H1>Moving Toward Electric Vehicles (EVs)</H1>

<P>
Are you aware of an incredible IEEE report, premiered in IEEE Spectrum --- "The EV Transition Explained", by Robert Charette, contributing editor of Spectrum. A self-described "risk ecologist", Charette is interested in the intersections of business, political, technological, and societal risks. Charette is an award-winning author of multiple books and numerous articles on the subjects of risk management, project and program management, innovation, and entrepreneurship. A Life Senior Member of the IEEE, Charette was a recipient of the IEEE Computer Society's Golden Core Award in 2008. And his report is a "Must-Read" if you have an interest in the coming EV revolution. Hint: It is much harder than most people are aware of or believe, and likely fraught with some unpleasant surprises. Here are a few "sticks of dynamite" taken directly from the report to think about.

Transitioning to electric vehicles and renewable energy to combat climate change are valid goals in themselves. Drastically reducing our fossil-fuel use is key to realizing those goals. However, attempting to make such transitions at scale in such a short period is fraught with problems, risks, and unanticipated consequences that need honest and open recognition so they can be actively and realistically addressed. Going to scale means not only manufacturing millions of EVs per year but supporting them from recharging to repair. A massive effort will be needed to make this happen.

Shifting a 125-year-old auto industry that's optimized for ICE-vehicle production to EVs using nascent technology is a monumental challenge. Requiring that automakers do so in 15 years or less is even more daunting, although part of it is their own doing by not recognizing earlier that EVs might be a threat to their business models. EVs require automakers and their suppliers to reinvent their supply chains, hire employees with new software, battery, and mechatronic skill sets, and retrain or else lay off workers whose outdated skills are no longer needed.

EVs alone aren't sufficient to meet carbon-reduction targets, which means enormous lifestyle changes for many of us, as we try to do our part to combat climate change. People will need to drive and fly less, walk and bike more, and take public transportation. We'll need to switch to a more plant-based diet and convert household appliances powered by fossil fuels to electricity, to name only a few looming adjustments. People's willingness to accept these changes and their ability to implement them will be crucial to our success at adapting to climate change and mitigating its impacts.
