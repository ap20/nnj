<H1>Help Keep IEEE Student Members Engaged</H1>

<P>
Like many professional organizations, IEEE student members often leave the professional nest after they graduate; and that is a shame because they miss out on so many things important to their early careers. If you have an opportunity to talk to IEEE student members, drive home important benefits for them if they remain active members. After 47 years of membership, here are some that come to mind:
</P>

<P>
--Partake in IEEE section activities and occupy positions where you can leave your mark and gain valuable professional experience directly applicable to your job. Practice the essentials of leadership and management skills on IEEE assignments. These gained skills are so fundamental and instantly transferable to your life everyday on-the-job.
</P>


<P>
--Learn about major new trends affecting your industry; and discuss them with many IEEE experts who have years of experience negotiating the currents and shoals of the electrical engineering profession.
</P>

<P>
--Learn about possible new job opportunities, exciting projects, and big challenges where you can make a contribution. So many opportunities often exist outside your corporate office. Be aware of them and how you might become a part of something new and exciting.
</P>

<P>
--Publish your work within a community of professionals who can serve as reviewers and guides to those all-important written and oral communication skills so absolutely essential to a successful engineering career.
</P>

<P>
--Build life-long friendships among engineers around the world; and enjoy the guidance of many possible mentors. In doing so, in years to come, you will also become a mentor in this time-honored tradition of passing the professional torch.
</P>

<P>
--Enjoy the opportunity to advance in membership grades, and improve your resume too. Companies do notice engineers who partake in professional society activities and continually improve themselves.
</P>

<P>
--IEEE conferences are many and well attended--places to learn the latest technologies and also to attend continuing education courses. It's a place to present technical papers, get yourself known and recognized as an expert in a field of study. Nothing pumps the professional soul like standing in front of an audience of your peers and giving a great presentation. [I fondly remember chairing IEEE Winter Power meeting photovoltaic system sessions in NYC-way back when photovoltaics was just starting to become recognized..., organizing the speakers and their papers, providing written comments on each paper, having breakfast with each speaker and introducing them during the session. All in all, a very professional experience!]
</P>

<P>
--Talk to the student members in your section and help them understand how important IEEE membership is to their careers. Convince them to invest early in IEEE. Just like a life-long portfolio or 401 k....the sooner they invest, the better interest and growth down the road!
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
