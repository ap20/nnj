<H1>Learning About Engineering</H1>

<P>
If it is April, I am usually at Montclair's Hillside Elementary school talking to 4th and 5th graders about engineering.  I am part of their Science Day event, where engineers and scientists from around the area spend a few hours with the students to describe what it is like to work in their chosen area of interest.

<P>
This program is part of the school's STEM activities and the new maker space the school recently built. Here are some of the questions each participant attempts to address:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> What childhood experiences helped shape your interest in this career ?
<LI> What challenges did you have to overcome to be in your career ?
<LI> In what ways do you work with/rely on other people to do your job ?
<LI> What contributions have you made or do you hope to make to society ?
<LI> What words of advice do you have for someone who is thinking about this career ? 
</UL>

<P>
Many students of course think engineering is all about science and math and design, but soon realize an engineer has many other constraints to deal with like economics, social benefits, environmental impacts, safety and other important topics before a specific kind of technology may be used to solve a problem.</P>

<P>
When speaking with students, regardless of age, I like to bring a sample of technology or one of my inventions to the classroom so they may appreciate that engineering is eventually about an application of technology in the real world... a product or service that benefits people.  Plus any prop I bring to the discussion always promotes even more questions about how that piece of technology was developed and how I worked in teams with other engineers and scientists to make it a reality.
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
