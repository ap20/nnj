<H1>Engineering Education Memories</H1>

<P>
In my basement lair, my eyes scan the many bookshelves there, especially the section containing the college texts I used at NCE [now part of NJIT], five decades ago. Yes, I still have those old texts. Casually flipping through random pages. I am zoomed back to the summer of 1966, around mid-August.
</P>

<P>
I distinctly remember that hot summer afternoon, when Dad drove me to NCE to pick up my freshman kit, the basic supply box for all incoming students. It seemed so intimidating and bulky, loaded with all sorts of books and academic materials for my first semester. I recall my inspirational high school science teacher's words..... "College is where you will meet many very smart people, the tops in their respective schools. Be ready for some stiff competition".  Was he ever right!
</P>

<P>
I also distinctly remember that first day of classes, a very full schedule with heavy rain pelting down all day, turning me into a very wet fellow; and this further complicated by the requirement for wearing a sport jacket and tie to attend classes. That first semester had me in contact with a professor for 28 hours per week. Today, the contact hours per week requirement is much shorter.
</P>

<P>
Always interested in chemistry, initially I envisioned taking courses in chemical engineering, but following several long discussions with Dad, decided to pursue electrical engineering. Later, I resolved my lingering devotion to chemistry, by doing my graduate work in environmental engineering---but I still love to read about advances in chemistry, especially electrochemistry.

<P>
Do you ever dream of college days? I have this dream every now and then, a dream of frustration, where I am on campus [always in the same engineering building] and cannot remember where my math test is being held, fitfully scurrying between rooms to find the elusive test site! Before you write me off as a strange person, other engineers have told me they also have collegiate academic nightmare dreams. Do you?
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
