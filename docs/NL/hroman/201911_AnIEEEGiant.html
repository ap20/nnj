<H1>An IEEE Giant</H1>

<P>
Let's see if you can identify this IEEE giant.
</P>

<P>
At Edison's legendary West Orange labs, this Canadian-born inventor  worked for about three years on a broad range of problems in chemistry, metallurgy, and electricity. Edison valued him for his ability to work out solutions across a variety of technical areas; and able to think on his feet. His initials... "RAF".
</P>

<P>
Here is a list of his "creds"... maybe this will help you identify him:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Held 500+ patents</LI>
<LI>Considered to be the Father of Radio-telephony</LI>
<LI>Taught electrical engineering at Purdue</LI>
<LI>Discovered the principle of amplitude modulation-leading to AM radio (heterodyne receivers)</LI>
<LI>Made the first audio radio transmission in 1900; music transmission in 1906</LI>
<LI>Helped engineer the Niagara Falls power plant</LI>
<LI>Helped install the lighting for the 1893 Chicago World Columbian Exposition</LI>

<LI>Received patents for tracer bullets, microfilm, television apparatus, turbo electric drive for ships, and more.</LI>

<P>
So... any idea who this great inventor was ?  It was Reginald Aubrey Fessenden.
</P>

<P>
One final note, Like Edison, he also had a WWII destroyer named after him, DE-142, the USS Fessenden.

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
