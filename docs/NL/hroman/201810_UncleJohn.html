<H1>Uncle John's Books</H1>

<P>
I remain fascinated with books, a house full of them it seems. There is my first science book; my cherished 1954 book about Thomas Edison [that launched my life-long interest in him]; but there is a special place in my personal library for "Uncle John's books".
</P>

<P>
Around 1958 or so a huge cardboard box arrived on our doorstep. So heavy it was, the delivery man had to carry it into our home. I remember the side of the box had an advertisement for Florida grapefruits. Inside were large, heavy books about physics, science, engineering and technology. Uncle John, a working physicist and early rocket engineer, had promised to feed my budding science interest; and he just delivered a seven-course meal to my doorstep.

<P>
The titles were bold and literary... "Man in a Chemical World", "Atoms, Rocks and Galaxies" among the more memorable. They seemed to speak of the destiny of science and engineering as important forces in the world. It all appealed so powerfully to my 4th grade mind. Those crisp old black and white book photos from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s still resonate for me.

With these book resources I developed a habit I continue today, reading before retiring at night -- fueling my head with ideas, food for dreams if you will. By the light of an old nautically decorated reading lamp, I journeyed near and far, meeting great scientists and engineers, astronomers, and inventors. The old table that held my long-gone reading lamp, has for many years held my computer scanner/printer... like my old books, still in-service.

Uncle John was the only brother in my father's family to attain a college education, working in the coal mines outside Pittsburgh, earning his college tuition and helping support his eight brothers and sisters.  Afterward he worked for the Bureau of Mines, performing research on mine safety, air/gas flammability concerns, and explosion minimization.  From there he matured into flame research and rocket propulsion consultancy in the early days of NASA, moving to Florida and supporting the rocket programs there... probably serving as a sub-contractor to the big companies down there.

<P>
Family legend has Uncle John working on secret projects, perhaps even interacting with Von Braun's engineers. I was both proud and awed, and did thank him for the wonderful books and the doors they opened for a hungry young mind.

<P>
Share your time and experience with young folks interested in science and engineering. It makes a big difference.</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
