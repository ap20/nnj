<H1>The Wisdom Within</H1>

<P>
Each of you reading this possesses the strategic wisdom our younger colleagues will need for a successful future. You all know.... five years into an engineering career, on-the-job skills gravitate strongly toward what traditional management aficionados refer to as soft skills. However, these skills are not soft by any means, and better termed "essential skills".

<P>
It is not so much about us being the design wizards by ourselves, but rather grooming others on our teams to join in and perform the work in a multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary fashion. In short, we "silverbacks" must be the leaders and teachers as well as the seasoned engineers. It is up to us, to prepare younger IEEE members for the workplace rigors they will face. Are we prepared to do so?  Here are the ten essential skills tomorrow's engineers will need to master for the workplace:
