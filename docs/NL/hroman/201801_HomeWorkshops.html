<h1>Home Workshops</h1>

<p>I wonder if there are still home workshops, places in the basement or a 
nearby garage where a
father and kids make things together? Judging from what I see going on in
classrooms and the lack of hand skills in young kids... I am very doubtful about
this time-honored tradition of learning at the knees of one’s parents.
Compounding this is the almost total disappearance of woodshops in elementary
schools. Are we at war with our hands?</p>

<p>My Dad was a subterranean creature, always downstairs in our little house, 
working in the basement workshop-a magical place we built together one Autumn
weekend many years ago. I remember all the math
involved--measuring out the working surfaces, shelf and storage space, and
cutting and assembling it all. From my early years through college, Dad and I
worked together on many repair and building projects. I go there often in my
dreams.</p>

<p>Working
with tools was always about taking responsibility, being able to fix things and
doing something useful with what I was learning in school. It was there in that
little workshop that Dad and I repaired TVs, radios, electric appliances and
anything else. My suite of activities in Head and Hands 101 also included other
activities like running electric circuits, plumbing, car repair, painting and
cement making. By age ten I could do much of this. </p>

<p>I remember my daughter asking one day, where did the old step stool in the pantry
come from? I replied I had made it for grandmother in my eighth grade shop
class... as a Mother’s Day gift. She was stunned. I took advantage of the
situation and walked her around the house, pointing out other wooden artifacts
I had created. With wide eyes she asked how did I know what to do to make it? I
explained it’s something you acquire by watching, listening and doing. No
books, lots of math to measure the stuff, some cutting, gluing, and nailing.
Sand it when you are done and varnish it to protect the wood’s surface. She is
still amazed her ancient old father could do this in elementary school.</p>

<p>It wasn’t so special to me and the kids I grew up with. Most of us had fathers who
were handy, and had some sort of little workspace where these ancient arts
could be practiced. My buddy Jim, at age 14, was quite a welder in his Dad’s
welding shop. I learned about welding from him. When I got to engineering
college everybody maintained their own cars and made repairs on the fly. In
fact, the school parking lots looked like a montage of hybridized cars, pieced
together as budgets would allow. Many of us spent more money on our cars in a
year than we did on tuition [NCE, now part of NJIT, was $235 a semester. Books
were another $100.]</p>

<p>In college labs, we were quite versed in building electrical equipment as almost
all of us had made motors or repaired electrical things in our youth. It seems
like such a different time today-much less discrete and more integrated, making
it perhaps harder for kids to learn through experimentation; and for shade-tree
mechanics to emerge. </p>


<p>One thing I remember most vividly about that workshop is the time I spent with my
father, getting to know him as a person; the discussions; the laughter; and the
shared satisfaction of making something work again. Although Dad was not an
engineer, he worked with them and knew what would be expected of me...how I
would lead others in teams, be responsible for their safety, and be required to
explain the work to be done in detail...and he was right. There in the workshop
Dad and I had many discussions about my choice of engineering school and what I
might major in, with me ultimately deciding upon electrical engineering at NCE.</p>

<p>When I got married, the first thing I did was build my own basement workshop. My
annual holiday gifts from Dad were almost always tools. He seemed to know
exactly when I would need what tools. In between, I would receive unusual gifts---
like the time he gave me several old coffee cans filled with odd-ball electric
fittings for home ceiling lights.  The
old house I bought, and still live in today, had a potpourri of ceiling
fixtures in every room, so those cans of special adaptors and such was just the
thing I needed. </p>

<p>Now I have all his tools in my workshop, including some from my grandfather. When I
need a little guidance about some tricky repairs at the house, I just hold some
of Dad’s tools and think about our times in the old workshop...and in a little
while, the answer comes.</p>

<p>*******************************</p>

<p>How can kids breeze through their early years missing that element of head and
hands learning, analyzing problems, and developing a discipline for problem
solving? It pays such dividends later in life. Are we afraid they might chose a
blue-collar job and not go to college, so we erase any youthful excursions into
the physical world? Are parents less handy today, so the kids miss out on the
joy of interacting with their parents?</p>

<p>When I was doing robotics research, and some early work in dexterous hands, I could
not help being impressed with our manual capabilities. Over 50% of the volume
of the frontal lobes of the brain is dedicated for the use of our hands. There
is a reason we have them; and they are meant to work with the rest of our
problem-solving processes. Modern brain-based research is continually
re-affirming the powerful learning connection between head and hands. When will
our schools start instituting much more of this? This is what STEM is supposed
to be all about, but it is painfully slow. As engineers we certainly can
appreciate this; and we can help young folks discover the joy of working with
their hands.</p>

<p> Talk to you again soon...</p>
