<H1>My First Big Project</H1>

<P>
I was out of college about three years, doing lots of power system engineering activities - network load flow analysis in particular. Our departmental principal engineer, Neale Sweetman, invited me to chat about an idea for somehow building a graphical user interface to display load flow analyses - something we might be able to see on a large TV-like picture tube. This could get rid of card decks and traditional digital simulations that took so much time, and removed "the feel" for a network's response; which often prompted the network engineer to run unnecessary shotgun blasts of different cases and simulations to hedge one's scenarios.
</P>

<P>
The big challenge of this discussion was there weren't graphical user interfaces available in the early 1970's, just bland tables of data displayed on simple CRT screens,  but nothing like an actual one-line diagram image to display line flows... in our case...26,000 volt sub-transmission networks to serve substations. Neale and I set to brainstorming the possible architecture and functions of a system which we dubbed The Graphic Planning System, or GPS.

Securing about $340,000 from the PSE&G annual budget [a really large sum of money for a developmental project back then] Neale and I and our IT staff team set about to develop a draft performance specification for the GPS that we could shop around for comments. Eventually we settled on a chosen vendor and began a two-year journey to develop and ultimately validate the system's ability to accurately run load flow analysis and display it, along with some bells and whistles to indicate line overloads, and the ability to toggle breakers and switches.

The system was a great success, completely changing the PSE&G distribution planning process with impressive time and manpower savings; and after many revisions and updates over the last 45 years is still being used by the company. What makes this story important is not just the really good performance and durability of the original design we came up with in 1973, but what Neale taught me about working with a young engineer like me:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Trust the engineer and instill in them permission to be creative and inventive; and to push, and if necessary, tear the conventional envelope to pieces;</LI>
<LI>Give the young engineer both responsibility and authority to run the project - let them make the important decisions;</LI>
<LI>Guide the engineer through the importance of writing articles and papers about the project, thus drawing interest in the engineering community to what is being done;</LI>
<LI>Let the young project manager take the bows for the success, basking in their glow.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
My work on this career-inspiring project led me to transfer to PSE&G's R&D group where I spent most of my 37-year career, developing and inventing many technologies for the company. I applied the leadership principles Neale taught me to all the young engineers I mentored and served on project teams with. Throughout our decades together at PSE&G, Neale and I remained close, and even in retirement we communicated. He passed recently at age 91, an amazing mentor and career-long friend... a long-time IEEE member...a leader I will never forget, and always try to emulate.

<P>
Thank you, Neale.

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
