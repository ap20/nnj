<H1>New Jersey - the Invention State</H1>

<P>
Perhaps New Jersey should no longer be called the Garden State, but rather the Invention State; in honor of the many patents awarded to its citizens. In a ranking of all 50 states, our state comes out 4th, behind California, New York and Texas respectively. Little New Jersey, reflecting the spirit of Thomas Edison, is a patent powerhouse.
</P>

<P>
Just off the top of my head, our citizens have invented: photovoltaic cells, the transistor, lasers/masers, liquid crystal displays, vacuum tubes, cell phones and mobile cellular communication systems, the telegraph code, the Telestar communications satellite, fiber optics, bar codes/scanners, color picture tubes, and radio astronomy.
</P>

<P>
How about: FM radio, telephone switching systems, touch-tone dialing, FAX machines, an artificial larynx, the hovercraft, highway clover leafs and circle, the steam locomotive and steam powered ships, the NJ concrete road barriers, the modern submarine and flight trainers/simulators.
</P>

<P>
As long as we invoked Mr. Edison earlier, let's cover his inventions as well:
recorded sound, motion pictures, electric light bulb and central power systems,
R&D Labs, fluoroscopy, florescent lights, alkaline storage batteries, dictation machines, radio telegraphy, carbon button transmitter, various electrical appliances, vastly improved telegraphy, the Edison Effect and poured concrete structures.
</P>

<P>
New Jersey has been referred to as the nations' medicine chest, with such credits as: a panoply of drugs and medicines for heart health, hypertension and anti-cancer applications, band aids, heart arterial stents, sunscreens, anti-bacterial toothpaste, the electron microscope, chlorination of water and laboratory glassware of all kinds.
</P>

<P>
Whew...that is impressive don't you think...but hang on for some really cool entertainment inventions/patents: solid body electric guitar, sound mixing/multi-track recording, compact file formats for music, flexible film, the Monopoly game, Play Doh, stereo sound, drive-in theaters and seashore boardwalks.
</P>

<P>
We all love to eat and enjoy the many foods we find here in our state like:
the ice cream cone, M&M's, Taylor Ham/pork roll, Bosco chocolate syrup, saltwater taffy, condensed soup [Campbell's], TV dinners, graham crackers...feeling hungry?
</P>

<P>
Glance around your house and see: pedal operated kitchen garbage cans, refrigerator door shelves, microwavable pots and pans, the vacuum cleaner, many laundry cleaners and detergents, the electric food mixer, electric knife, and rotating lawn sprinkler.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget some sports inventions too, such as: the golf tee, baseball catcher's mask, batter's cage, the venerable Flexible Flyer sled, and some argue the game of baseball itself was first played here and the modern rules invented here as well.
</P>

<P>
I almost forgot...fiber reinforced packing and shipping tapes, various lubricants, bubble wrap, Teflon, anti-theft tags for clothes and Bakelite.  Not all of the many inventions for sure, but a very nice sampling of what creative New Jersey minds have accomplished. Tell your children and grandchildren about little New Jersey-the invention state!

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
