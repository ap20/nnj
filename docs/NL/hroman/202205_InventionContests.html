<H1>Invention Contests -- Popular Among Students</H1>

<P>
Since 2009 the Edison Pitch Contest has sponsored a national invention and pitch contest to teach the principles of invention and entrepreneurship. This year the program has really popped its buttons with a 50% increase in registrations! 84 schools across 27 states are involved. Student team registrations have zoomed from 205 last year to 301 this year, with a jump in total students involved from 540 to 817.

<P>
Student teams are free to choose the categories in which they submit their inventions. They have typically invented in categories like community development, animals, education, environment and medical. This year the students are heavy into the environment category, with medical running second. Leading the pack this year are middle school entries, followed by high school and then elementary. If statistics hold as they have been, young ladies will be more than worthy competitors, especially in the middle school division.

All these contestant teams will keep the judges busy as top honors are determined. The Edison Innovation Foundation will hold the presentations and awards ceremony in mid-May at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, NJ. Always an "electric evening" as top candidates enthusiastically present their inventions, it's a night when Tom Edison smiles down on everyone there!

Tell your teacher friends about this national opportunity. Tell them to put it on their calendar for next year. For more information, see https://www.thomasedisonpitch.org.
