<H1> Be an Engineer </H1>

<P>
Have you seen the TV commercials by Exxon Mobil about being an engineer? 
These commercials are not only very well done, featuring young folks excited 
by what they could accomplish, but these thirty second or so vignettes 
strike a resounding chord about how engineers change the world... it 
all being "part of the job description”. Check out several of these 
exciting commercials at

This is some of the best inspirational stuff about the profession I have seen. 
Young folks want to make a difference; and these commercials appeal to young 
minds at a visceral level-showing how engineers are the agents of change in 
the world. I think it puts engineering right up there with other professions 
like medicine, law, and business that often eclipse it in appeal. Maybe IEEE 
and other engineering societies ought to honor Exxon Mobil for the work they 
have done.

Listen to what Rex Tillerson, now Secretary of State and former Chairman 
and CEO of Exxon Mobil, says about engineering:

We've got to help young people understand how exciting the world of the 
engineer is to be able to create things that have never been created before.

<P>
One of the challenges we've had as a profession is that young people don't 
really know what an engineer does. And it can take on a certain connotation 
of being nothing more than a technician, when in reality scientists discover 
things and help us understand why they are. Mathematicians help us 
calculate and measure.
</P>

<P>
Engineers are the marriage of science and mathematics. We take those two 
things, we put them together and we create everything around us, from your 
iPad to this building we're sitting in to the medium that we're broadcasting 
to people today to the houses we live in to the cars we drive. They are all 
engineering products.

Can you remember what turned you on to engineering? Often it is a family member 
or a teacher that lights the flame. What was it for you? For me it was my father, 
my uncle, and an inspirational high school science teacher. All contributed in 
their own way to my decision to become an engineer.

About the closest thing today for kids to be inspired about engineering is 
when they start taking STEM-related courses in school, learning how engineers 
solve problems from a 360-degree perspective; taking into account the whole 
picture from the technical, economic, environmental, legal, safety, and 
regulatory standpoints. Learning and applying the engineering process, 
hopefully, this will prompt young minds to delve deeper into what engineers 
do: including creating new inventions and patenting them; saving lives with 
the application of technology; generating the systems and infrastructures 
that will create national wealth; increasing our standards of living; 
and keeping us globally competitive.

Teachers know that relevancy is powerful stuff, driving classroom lessons 
home, making them stick with a special type of glue. Having engineers visit 
a classroom to basically testify how the math and science is used to make 
some very cool applications or new products/services really tells the 
story-and can close the deal about young folks wanting to be engineers. 
There is a rich story to be told about engineering. Exxon Mobil obviously 
wants to tell the story. We should want to tell it too, with passion. 
So why not visit a school near you?

<P> Talk to you again soon...</P>
