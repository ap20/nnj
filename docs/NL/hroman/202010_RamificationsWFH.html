<H1>Some Ramifications of Working at Homee</H1>

<P>
Think about what could happen if the recent "work at home" experience becomes permanent. Let's look at this situation just from an electric perspective; such as:
</P>

<UL style="list-style-type: none; ">
<LI>-If we no longer work in those big office buildings, but rather from home...what does this do to urban power system networks?

<LI>-Can residential / suburban distribution circuits handle the increases in daytime electric use for home offices?

<LI>-Would utility companies become legally liable for lost work productivity because of residential circuit outages?

<LI>-Who pays for circuit reinforcement in residential / suburban areas?

<LI>-If no longer cooled by employers at work...what is electric load impact on local circuits as home offices use their own air conditioning?

<LI>-Composite loads on local circuits will reflect back to regional and bulk system capacity...what will impacts be on the transmission system?

<LI>-On top of this, what about electric vehicle charging loads  [especially if long distance capable cars are no longer needed for work commutation]?

<LI>-What about feedback from rooftop solar-photovoltaic systems...how would this further impact local circuits?
</UL>

<P>
So what do you think? Working at home, just from the electric energy use aspect, really can change our established way of life. What other impacts might you envision...even beyond just the electrical ramifications? Hint: there are many other impacts!

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
