<H1>What Inventors and Entrepreneurs do for Us</H1>

<P>
Let's remember and thank America's inventors and entrepreneurs for what they do for us. Here is a short list to help you get started in recognizing the importance of their efforts and long hours of labor amid many obstacles and roadblocks:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> Agents of change and economic growth
<LI> Commercialize new products and services
<LI> Drive down costs to consumers 
<LI> Create new jobs and industries
<LI> Improve our standards of living
<LI> Clean the environment
<LI> Make things safer
</UL>

<P>
If you gave it some serious thought, you could probably double or triple the size of this list.
</P>

<P>
In pursuing answers to important questions and problems that need to be resolved, these creative folks lead their teams through the narrow, hazardous straits of product commercialization. Often the true joy of these efforts is the race to success itself. If you have ever tried to introduce something new either on your own or within a rigid corporate environment, you know the landmines and snares that await you.
</P>

<P>
You do not need to go far to find these invaluable inventors and entrepreneurs, for they are right here in our IEEE section. When you meet one or learn of their accomplishments, take the time to tell them how much you appreciate what they did. Even better yet tell school-age and college students what colleagues and friends you have in our section!
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
