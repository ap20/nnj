<H1>Thomas Edison and Electric Vehicles</H1>

<P>
With all the talk about the importance of charging electric vehicles in our home garages, many Americans think this is something so radically new we must have an immediate national effort to encourage it.
</P>

<P>
Today, you can see Tom Edison's original electric vehicle garage charging station at his Glenmont Garage, located at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park, in West Orange, NJ. The point of all this is Tom was charging electric vehicles in this facility way back at the turn of the last century--quite some time ago; and he did so until his death in 1931. Did I mention his station could re-charge three vehicles simultaneously?
</P>

<P>
His equipment was bulky of course and reflected the state of the art back then, whereas today's equipment is easily wall-mounted and convenient to use. And thanks to Elon Musk (and others), you can integrate battery and electric vehicle re-charging with solar (photovoltaic) panels on the roof of a home.
</P>

<P>
I can almost hear Mr. Edison lamenting......."C'mon folks, what are you waiting for?"
</P>

<P>
By the way, Edison was experimenting with electric trucks as well in the 1920's / 30's. Did you folks at Ford hear this?
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
