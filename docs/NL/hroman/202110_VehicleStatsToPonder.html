<H1>Vehicle Stats to Ponder</H1>

<P>
Today, in the U.S., more than 280 million vehicles are on the road. Of that, about 2-3% are totally or partially (hybrid) electric. We have a large inertia of existing vehicles to overcome before electric vehicles make a big dent in the vehicle economy, but work on this worthy goal continues.

What is so fascinating is back in the early 1900's, here is what the breakdown of vehicle types on the road was:

<LI> Electric - 38%
<LI> Gasoline - 22%

Yes, you read that right. Electric vehicles were number two in popularity, until cheap and plentiful gasoline, and abundant low-cost Model T’s, made gas powered cars the economic choice for getting out and exploring the country, with engineered roads soon following.

People wanted to visit places where the railroads could not conveniently go. Americans voted with both their pocketbooks and sense of adventure and travel. The cheap Model T made by Ford, and the Rockefeller oil/gas production / distribution system, delivered the knock-out punch to electric vehicles. It has been that way since the 1920's.

We certainly are heading back to an electric vehicle future, no doubt; and remember this.....Thomas Edison was charging his electric vehicles in his historic garage in West Orange as early as 1904, 117 years ago. Musk and Ford.....are you hearing this?! In fact, that charging system is still there at West Orange for wide-eyed visitors to see.
