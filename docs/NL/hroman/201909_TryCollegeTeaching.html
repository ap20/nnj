<H1>Try College Teaching</H1>

<P>
Teaching is a powerful way to put an edge on your "technological blade".  It gets you noticed at the college, and in your own company.  It also improves your speaking, presentation and organization skills.
</P>

<P>
Sometimes opportunities come out of the blue, like the time a professor friend of mine called one early spring evening to ask if I wanted to teach a graduate level course in R&D project management, come the fall semester.  His reasoning was... I do this stuff all day long; and they need someone to present real world aspects of this important business function.  The sugar on top was I would have complete control of course content.  I accepted the offer.  During that summer, I prepared the course; and come the fall semester I was off and running.
</P>

<P>
For nine years I taught the course, had a blast, and became very sharp in matters concerning the R&D world-which made me very effective at work; someone who could now see the depth and perspective of this subject... moving from someone who knew how to do R&D to someone who could speak deeply and passionately about its value and importance to global competition.
</P>

<P>
Moral of the story: think about teaching what you know, taking it to the next level.  Do not underestimate how valuable your work knowledge is, both process and content.  This is how teaching and consulting careers get established, especially as post/early retirement options.
</P>

<P>
I also have many engineering friends who have become teachers because they possessed the ability to use math and science in real applications, and today are now valuable teachers in both middle and high schools.
