<H1>Elon Musk on Edison and Tesla</H1>

<P>
Nothing gets a group of techies whipped into a frenzy more than someone who wants to debate Edison versus Tesla. Believe me, I know.  Many times have I lectured about Edison at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in nearby West Orange, when someone kicks the whole discussion up a notch to bring in the Edison-Tesla controversy.

Both men are valuable innovators in the electrical engineering profession, who historically changed the world for the better. In their own ways, they made their unique contributions. I have always felt to try and compare them head-to-head was not proper, despite the passionate urgings of my lecture visitors.

<P>
Now there comes to my attention a very short video featuring Elon Musk talking about Edison and Tesla, which can be viewed at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5OOI6sYK-NM. Perhaps this will satisfy those that wish to argue which electrical engineering hero is the greatest.... although, my intuition says otherwise.

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
