<H1>Our Cell Phones Easily Could Guide us to the Moon</H1>

<P>
As we celebrate our 50th anniversary of the moon landing, let's take a look and compare the computer used to get our astronauts to the moon versus the computing power of a cellphone today. As you probably expect, our cellphones are a whole lot more powerful. These figures that follow are composites I gathered from written articles, radio broadcasts and social media.

<P>
The Apollo Guidance Computer had 32KB RAM, and 72KB of ROM. That's right... KB!
</P>

<P>
An iPhone with 4GB of RAM packs more than 1 million times more memory than the Apollo computer. Comparing ROM, a 512GB iPhone is 7 million times more powerful than the guidance computer. As we all know, our phones can store thousands of emails, songs and photographs.

<P>
The processor on the Apollo 11 computer ran at .043 MHz. The latest iPhone processor runs at an estimated 2,490 Mz... 100,000 times more processing power.
</P>

<P>
The science publication <I>ZME Science </I> also compared processing speeds of the two computers. Even with the now-ancient iPhone 6, Apple's A8 ARM architecture held about 1.6 billion transistors capable of processing 3.36 billion instructions per second. That makes it 120 million times faster than the computer guiding Apollo. Basically, an iPhone could be used to guide 120 million Apollo-era spacecraft to the moon, all at the same time.

<P>
All you EE's out there should be very proud of your technological achievements and advances in electrical and computer engineering. Keep up the good work.
</P>

<P> Now...Mars! </P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
