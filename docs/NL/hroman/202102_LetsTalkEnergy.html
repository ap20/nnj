<H1>Let's Talk Energy</H1>

<P>
Yes, let's talk energy, specifically.....what we use to generate electricity here in America. Here are the facts for 2020:
</P>

<TABLE>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
	<TD>Natural Gas</TD> <TD>38%</TD>
</TR>	
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
	<TD>Coal</TD> <TD>25%</TD>
</TR>	
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
	<TD>Nuclear</TD> <TD>20%</TD>
</TR>	
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
	<TD>Hydro</TD> <TD>7%</TD>
</TR>	
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
	<TD>Wind</TD> <TD>8%</TD>
</TR>	
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
	<TD>Solar</TD> <TD>2%</TD>
</TR>	
</TABLE>

<P>
Notice the virtual absence of oil in the mix. Coal and natural gas were substituted for oil, years ago, as imported oil costs were exorbitant. For instance, in 1970, oil accounted for 12% of all electricity generated; and in 2005, 3%. But now, oil's contribution is less than 0.3%.
</P>

<P>
In 2016, Natural gas use crossed that for coal... as you probably would expect as the world is trying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But remember, the US use of coal for power plants is much less than that in China, India and probably Russian territories; and those countries are planning to build even more coal based plants.
</P>

<P>
So if we radically reduce our coal use, the emissions from those countries will still spoil the atmosphere with carbon dioxide [and it may economically hurt us to "de-coal" our generation mix].
