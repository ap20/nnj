<H1>A Coming Problem</H1>

<P>
I am worried about this COVID virus impact on education. Our students are probably one-year behind in their studies, at the very least. This worries me specifically in the math and sciences. These two inter-related disciplines must be built on solid foundations before moving forward to ever increasing skill difficulties. I do not think distance learning techniques help build a robust foundation.
</P>

<P>
More and more, I can foresee students needing remedial education in the math and sciences. A solid foundation in these two disciplines involves constant practice in the application of mathematical and scientific principles; and it helps very much to have social interactions among fellow students and teacher-mentors. This early give and take among future engineers and scientists is an essential part of the maturation process.
</P>

<P>
Absent key elements of the maturation process, I fear great voids will be exposed in a student's education toward college. This will inevitably result in entry level collegiate students being required to take make-up or remedial education courses before their mainline engineering courses, which can drain collegiate resources and discourage engineering students, possibly raising college costs. Students may leave engineering to pursue other fields - or realize they must delay their graduation dates.
</P>

<P>
All of this is not good for students and the engineering profession. How shall we deal with it?

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
