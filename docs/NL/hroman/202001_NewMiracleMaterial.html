<H1>A New Miracle Material?</H1>

<P>
Just one atom thick, it is an allotrope of carbon arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal (honeycomb) arrangement. It is 100 times stronger than the best steel, conducts heat and electricity, and is transparent. This "miracle substance" is being touted for a huge variety of potential applications, with robust research underway the world over.

<P>
It is a cousin to the "lead" in a common pencil and is more conductive than copper. This substance is also related to fullerenes and nanotubes. And here is an amazing feature of this substance...self-healing, when exposed to the right chemicals!
</P>

<P>Know what it is ? </P>
<P>Graphene!</P>

<P>Here are some exciting possibilities, in a non-prioritized laundry list:</P>

<P>
As I write this, I see a TV commercial advertising this anti-aging application of a graphene based product to reduce face wrinkles and under eye bags! Now that is a wide ranging technology.

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
