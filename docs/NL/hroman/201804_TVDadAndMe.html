<H1>TV, Dad and Me</H1>

<P>
It was a time of innocence and expectation, when voice and vision conquered 
the night. Our fathers had learned to hurl movies through time and space-right
into our living rooms. They called it television... and from the front seat of 
my dad's sea-green, 1950 Pontiac, I rode the crest of that phenomenon.
</P>

<P>
Despite a layer of dust, courtesy of my basement workshop, the old tube 
and tool caddy we carried into customer homes still contains fresh memories 
of those days. Inside this vinyl covered, time-worn plywood suitcase reside 
the smells and technology of my youth. I remember still the purpose and function 
of the many vacuum tubes yet contained within this sturdy, personal time machine. 
Dad gave me the caddy a few years before he died. He taught me the TV business 
as he had learned it, and he taught me well. A father's training is a special 
kind of glue.
</P>

<P>
Every evening after dinner, we loaded the tube caddy and a tube tester into the 
old Pontiac and made house calls throughout our county, ministering to sick and 
misbehaving black and white TV sets. Everything seemed new then. Even the now 
golden oldies coming out of the radio speaker were just recorded. Sometimes we 
sang along to Patti Page, Rosemary Clooney, or Connie Francis songs-dad's 
favorite singers- as we traveled between service calls. If our night went well, 
we fixed maybe 4-5 sets, and kept families happy in front 
of that soft, anesthetic glow. 
</P>

Folks in the fledgling TV business back then knew us as the father and 
son team.  We fixed the sets, put aerials on roofs and chimneys, took very sick 
TV sets to the shop for expert diagnosis and repair, and in a pinch, fixed radios. 
I remember seeing my first color TV show, The Flintstones, while waiting for an 
electronics technician to finish up repairing someone's badly damaged set. I 
stood there for the whole show with my mouth open catching flies until dad shook 
me out of my reverie. We soon had to learn about color sets so we could fix them 
too. The technology just kept advancing, dragging us along with it, a harbinger 
of personal computers and the Internet to come. 
</P>

Dad worked that little part-time business for over 25 years, until he finally 
surrendered to printed circuits and all transistor sets. He had reached his learning 
limit, but it was a great ride. And I went to college and became an electrical engineer, 
fulfilling dad's longtime dream for me.
</P>

<P>
The old Pontiac met its fate one evening when dad had the back seat loaded with 
picture tubes and sets destined for the shop. Speeding teenagers ran a red traffic 
signal and slammed into the car detonating the picture tubes in the back seat. The 
explosion blew a hole in the roof of the old Pontiac. The real miracle was that 
dad escaped without a scratch. All that flying glass, and fortunately nothing had 
struck dad. The police officers were amazed, as was dad, mom, my sisters and me. In 
all the ensuing years, I never found a car with that color green paint again. It was 
a honey. Somewhere in my basement workshop is the little suction cup thermometer 
that was affixed to the dash of that car.
</P>

<P>
Many times I have thought about checking with the Smithsonian folks to see if there 
is any interest in that old tube caddy as maybe a genuine piece of Americana from 
the early 1950s. I figured it would be a nice way to honor dad's role in ushering 
in the age of television. But sometimes when I open that suitcase, I swear I can 
smell my dad's aroma mixed in with the other familiar stuff, and it's awfully 
hard to part with that. 
</P>

<P>
Just the other day, I bumped into someone from my old neighborhood, a person I 
had not immediately remembered. She obviously remembered me after 50+ years, and 
started the conversation by saying, "Didn't your dad fix TV sets many years ago? 
I remember he fixed ours." I managed to choke out a "Yes" in reply, ....between 
the welling tears. Folks still remember.

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
