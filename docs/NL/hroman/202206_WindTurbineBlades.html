<H1>Wind Turbine Blades-What to do with Discarded Ones?</H1>

<P>
There are probably over 58,000 wind turbines in the U.S., with an estimated 3,000+ more planned to be erected by the end of this year. Turbine blades need to be replaced as frequently as every 10 years due to natural deterioration, damage or upgrades. As more turbines go up, it becomes a major issue to deal with so much bulky turbine blade waste.

The current process for getting rid of these blades is to cut them into manageable pieces, pile them up, and cover them with dirt like a mass grave. In the U.S. alone, about 8,000 will be removed in each of the next four years. Over 2 million tons of wind turbine blades will need to be disposed of by 2050.

For wind energy, strong, yet lightweight fiberglass blades allow turbine blades to spin more efficiently and produce more output than other materials; but as a glass composite, they resist biodegrading over time, and are challenging to recycle. Maybe better blade materials could be used to give them a longer life in the first place, thus reducing the landfill needs until a solution can be found. Might the big blades be simply chopped up for some kind of re-use later?

Sounds like this could be a great collegiate challenge, a national contest by wind turbine manufacturers to solve a real problem and perhaps also to interest young engineers in a career in the wind industry. Might IEEE see this as an appropriate green energy challenge for electrical engineering students...maybe working in concert with mechanical engineering students from ASME? What would you do with old wind turbine blades?

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
