<H1>Words of Wisdom</H1>

<P>
Here are some powerful words of wisdom, given over 155 years ago by a small town Midwestern mother to her young son. Plenty to think about here in these four simple truths.

<P>
<B><U>Do not be afraid to fail. Keep trying, learn from failure; and try again.</U></B>
</P>
<P>
Accomplished people often swear that persistence is a key element to long-term success. "Pick your-self up...dust your-self off...and try again" is another way to express this truth. We often encourage students and our children to never stop trying. It certainly is frustrating to experience failure after failure. It seems easier to just stop. Scientists and engineers, working on new systems, know this disappointment well. Laboratory notebooks tell the story of why things failed, and after suitable reflection, what might have been the problem; and so the cycle starts anew. Inventors know this frustration too as they struggle to make something new become reality. This is why team-based learning is important, because the team is stronger than any single person and makes for a stronger psychology for continuing...and as they use to say "two heads are better than one".

<B><U>It is OK to work with your hands and your head. Not everything important comes from books. Experience the world and learn from it.</U></B>

Boy is this important for people to grasp, especially the young ones. We spend so much time ingraining in our youth how they must get good academic grades we ignore the relevance of real-world learning. The head and hands mantra is right out of the technology education and STEM / STEAM curriculum; which follows directly from the very important brain-based learning paradigms of the last 20 years. Humans learn more meaningfully when their whole bodies are engaged. Many astute educators know that real learning happens when the kids are on their feet, out of the chairs, and focused on goals and team-based activities. Even our dynamic information based companies like Google know that real world learning is as important and often more important than sterile book learning. Here is something to remember. Over half of the frontal lobes of the human brain are dedicated to the use of one's hands; and since hands are not likely to disappear anytime soon, why not encourage the use of them?

<P>
<B><U>Read across the entire span of literature, not just what you like.</U></B>
</P>
<P>
If you only read what you like, then your experiences will be quite limited. There is so much more to life and many exciting ideas to experience. I remember a popular 1950's saying that was plastered all over the walls of the schools I went to... "Be all you can be... READ!" That slogan has never gone out of style, and rightfully so. What one learns from many different genres can someday be food for thought in different areas, or provide inspiration for problems to be solved. Think of the many wonderful quotes we all encounter in a lifetime, and how these can spark thinking in other parts of our lives. Do you have a favorite poem that you return to in tough times? How often have you read passages from the good book when you needed some solace? Literature opens many doors. Embrace it with an open heart and mind. Ponder what other minds have wrestled with.

<P>
<B><U>Never stop learning, keep improving yourself.</U></B>
</P>

Every professional knows this lesson. You cannot expect your college experience to last indefinitely. Skills and know-how can obsolesce. After 5-10 years on the job, over three-quarters of what any seasoned engineer uses most may have little to do with the technical literature mastered in engineering school. The professional skills tend to dominate, and must be mastered in turn. Continuous learning, both technical and non-technical, is the main currency in an information/knowledge rich society.

The insights in these simple truths were expounded by Nancy Elliot Edison, mother of Thomas Edison, and herself a trained normal school teacher who was not working at the time, busy raising her family. She had taken young Thomas out of the third grade because the one room schoolhouse he attended just did not motivate his way of thinking. Following his mother's simple educational strategy, Thomas blossomed-later always giving credit to his mother's wisdom and for saving him from a youth of educational drudgery.

Thank you Nancy, for rescuing young Tom, and putting his feet on the path to greatly improving the world. And thank you for the words of wisdom.
