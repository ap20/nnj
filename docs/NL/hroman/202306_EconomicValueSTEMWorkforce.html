<H1>The Economic Value of the STEM Workforce</H1>

<P>
A new and powerful study has just hit the streets, entitled, "Science is US"--an inclusive analysis of the U.S. STEM workforce and its economic impact. It was produced with support from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation (Copyright 2023). Here are the salient points of this study.

<LI> STEM Jobs Pay More, Produce More and Contribute More than Non-STEM Jobs.
<LI> More than 67 million workers in the United States are STEM professionals, making up 34.3% of the nation’s workforce---up from 64 million workers in 2017 comprising 32.7% of the nation's workforce.
<LI> The majority of U.S. STEM professionals, 55.4 percent, do not hold a bachelor’s degree.
<LI> Direct STEM economic activity accounted for $9.45 trillion in 2021 equating to 40.5% of U.S. GDP.  Up from $7.66 trillion and 39.3 % of U.S. GDP in 2017.
<LI> The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2031 STEM employment will increase by more than twice the rate of non-STEM employment.

<P>
To keep this economic juggernaut on the rails, our country will need to make sure we engage, motivate, and inspire the next generation of STEM professionals, with a focus and investment in STEM education in PK-12 schools along with expanded opportunities for continuing education. Our position in strategic global markets will be at stake if we let this important need lapse.
