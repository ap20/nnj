<H1>Building with Soda Straws—Observing Student Teams</H1>

<P>
For most of my career, I have worked with schools in a variety of capacities, bringing the world of engineering and creativity into the classroom. A few years back I visited a local 6th grade school to try an interesting experiment - building towers primarily with soda straws and some other materials. I had done this challenge numerous times before at different schools, but this time I was trying to get a realistic measure and understanding of the success rate of student teams.
</P>

<P>
I was able to assemble over the course of four days, about 300 students to take my experimental test, 100 three-person teams in all. During this 2-hour adventure, students were urged to build the highest possible tower with available materials (soda straws, some paper clips, pipe cleaners and a small amount of masking tape) that could support a golf ball at the top of the tower.
</P>

<P>
Here is what I found:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> 72 teams were successful in building a measurable tower
<LI> 28 teams unsuccessful - essentially nonstarters
<LI> The largest tower was 100 cm tall compared to the smallest which was about 7 cm; with many tower sizes in the 10-59 cm height range.
<LI> Teams that failed or were not producing robust towers had a variety of problems:
<UL>
<LI> One student dominating the design challenge-turning other team members off
<LI> Over analyzing the challenge and afraid to start doing something different
<LI> Turned-off students-lack of interest
<LI> Poor spatial visualization-not able to visualize the third dimension
<LI> Lack of appreciation of building structures and supporting loads
<LI> Over emphasis on building some sort of special assembly to hold the ball.	
</UL>

<LI> There was no clear-cut defining difference between gifted kids and traditional students, or their teams in performance. 

<LI> The highest tower (100 cm) was achieved by three girls who according to teachers had class problems, and generally rebellious in their studies. In this exercise their transformation into a tight and well-performing team was clearly visible. The head and hands paradigm had kicked-in!
</UL>

<P>
Over my many years in classrooms, I offer this general observation: in the elementary and middle school grades, young ladies are ferocious problem-solvers; but seem to lose interest in high school. This is discouraging and should be investigated further.
</P>

<P>
Another piece of information from my experience: students who did not have good command of the language (migrants) and often handicapped students were also great head and hands team members. It was as though their head and hands skills burst wide open when given the opportunity to do so!
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
