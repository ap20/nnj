<H1>Working with the Little Ones</H1>

<P>
For about 50 years now, I have enjoyed working with teachers at various 
schools to bring the excitement of science and technology into the classroom. 
Since retiring about 12 years ago, I have been doing many sci-tech demos 
at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange where I am a 
docent and sort of resident inventor. I also do my demos at several local 
schools in West Orange and Montclair. Hands down, the best audiences are 
the young ones... grades 3 thru 6.

I guess it is the sparkle in their eyes that fascinates me, the moment 
when everything clicks, and they understand. It is so honest and real 
as that huge smile comes to their lips. They almost seem to vibrate with 
excitement.

A favorite among my many demo activities involves making wet cell batteries...
two dissimilar metals, safe salt water as the electrolyte, a simple 
voltmeter and the kids respond like crazy. They instantly start experimenting 
with trying to hook multiple cells together, soon discovering series circuits. 
Then they start trying different metal pairs. Parallel circuits elude them at 
first, but a little explanation and they get the message.

Been working on something really cool for them... an eye-popper...
using Play Doh as a conductor of electricity and lighting up some LEDS. 
But I have something more powerful in store for them... Play Doh wet cells...
no liquid needed... just put the metals in and read a voltage. Boy are 
they going to smile at that one. Got all these demos out on my big basement 
workshop table ready to go. Mama bought me some serious containers of Play 
Doh, and I plan to use them all!

Maybe you have had the pleasure of working with the young ones too. If you 
have, you know the incredible questions they can ask. I encourage you to spend 
some time in the classroom. It is highly rewarding and so important for 
students to see role models who can talk and do sci-tech. I recently sat on 
a panel at a science day celebration at a Montclair elementary school -- about 
12 panels were in the school visiting the children in grades 3 thru 5. That 
old school was pulsating with excitement as the young students learned how all 
those science visitors had started their careers and what they do every day on 
the job. Amazing stuff for young students to hear.

There is another benefit from working with teachers and young students. You 
will feel young again. And it's OK to take a little nap when you get back 
home. I do so all the time. All that fun will tire you out!

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
