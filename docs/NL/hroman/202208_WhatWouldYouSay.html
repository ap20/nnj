<H1>What Would You Say?</H1>

<P>
So.... what would you tell them ? The students I mean. What would you tell them about engineering ?
</P>

<P>
Would you describe what engineers have done over the centuries, perhaps emphasizing how the profession dates back to ancient times, the wonders of the world, and the carving out of civilization? Maybe you would show pictures of the great aqueducts of Italy; or images of great buildings of the past; or possibly the majestic pyramids as well.
</P>

<P>
In modern times you might show photos of the great bridges we use every day or images of rocket ships blasting off to the Moon; or simply hold up a cell phone and discuss how it connects to the world's galactic library, where everyone can browse the stacks electronically. There are so many examples.
</P>

<P>
The point here is how many of us talk to students about engineering, exciting them to the creativity, invention, and excitement of turning raw ideas into real products and services? When was the last time you visited a school, or talked to an IEEE student section? Have you brought one of your inventions to a class of engineering students to have them comment and discuss what you accomplished?
</P>

<P>
Would you mention how the "engineering design process", so central to the STEM education curriculum today, is the heart and soul of the engineer's daily routine -- and is essentially what Thomas Edison did all the time in his invention factory ?
</P>

<P>
Might you emphasize how employers prize the robust application of engineering principles and creative thought, more than the specific subjects that were taken -- process over content. Would you tell them of your career - the high points, and the low ones too? What would you say about engineering? When do you plan to next visit with students?
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
