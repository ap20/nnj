<H1>New Product Development Truths</H1>

<P>
Some years back, I was privileged to teach a graduate course in R&D and new product development. Here are five powerful truths that came out of that course.
</P>

<P>
75% of all new product launch failures can be traced back to poor interdepartmental communications in the nascent phases of the product's development.
</P>

<P>
Only 65% of all new patent applications become issued patents. And of those issued patents, only 2% become highly successful.
</P>

<P>
For every product you see on a store shelf, there were probably 49 or 50 failures that never made it to that shelf.
</P>

<P>
A company needs to generate about 164 raw new product ideas to achieve 4 really, good commercial products.
</P>

<P>
Employees must live and breathe creativity and innovation if that company wants to be a market powerhouse. Creativity and innovation are the province of corporate leadership.
</P>

<P>
So many of my students went on to become leaders in their industries. Teaching is a powerful way to help change the world. If you are able, become a teacher / mentor. Leave your mark upon tomorrow!
</P>


<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
