<H1>Write Technical Papers</H1>

<P>
Want to get known in your industry? Write technical papers and present them at conferences, or in technical publications, and your career will start to get very interesting.  People in the industry will start gravitating toward you, asking for your comments, and asking questions about your work. All this strengthens your thinking, expands your influence, and helps to hatch new ideas.  It can also bring you and others together to partner on new projects or business ventures.  It might even lead to a new job opportunity.

You get known by what others read about you and your work.  Part of being the consummate professional is to enrich the industry through your research and professional papers.  I have found it very exciting to write a paper that other professionals critique, get published, and then present the paper at a conference where maybe one-hundred or more fellow engineers are present and ask questions.

One of the really fun IEEE activities I did for about five years was to be Program Chair for the Photovoltaic Working Group.  My job as Program Chair was to have each paper reviewed by three engineers, along with questions to be asked.  I then developed a back-drop story for each paper and wrote a
formal critique of each paper to be published... and printed at the end of each  paper in the conference transactions.  I had a wonderful time meeting the authors, discussing their work, and introducing them to a packed audience - and moderating the vigorous Q&A sessions that certainly followed.

Here is something to think about.  My first bosses, well-respected IEEE members, challenged each of us young engineers to write an IEEE paper each year and present it.  Just a few years out of college I was in front of men and women from all over the world discussing my ideas and work.  I still feel that tingle when I walk up to the microphone and tell everyone who I am and what I think.  This is a must do activity for anyone who has aspirations to rise in their profession.  Don't let the parade pass you by... publish your work!
