<H1>What Characterizes Great Inventors?</H1>

<P>
Companies and educators try to define creativity and inventiveness. Business gurus and motivational speakers earn lucrative fees by likening it to a series of traits that can be easily identified and exploited. They know inventors are agents of change and great economic growth; moving the world in new directions, creating wealth and often new infrastructure. They are the ones who shift the paradigms, causing earthquakes in the fabric of civilization. Consider these traits below [<b>not</b> in ranked or priority order] that characterize great inventors.

Many great inventors enjoy a natural "play" associated with their work: the thrill of chasing down a problem; being the first to solve a problem; possessing an almost child-like awe of the world. What a potion this would make for education at all levels today! STEM educators see this today in the natural exuberance of their young head and hands project teams. Do you see it in the people you manage and lead on the job? Think of the best project team you ever participated in. Did it have this excitement?
