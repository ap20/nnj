<H1>The Ford F-150 Lightning Truck-Redefining the Utility Industry?</H1>

<P>
Have you read much about Ford's new F-150 Lightning electric truck?
</P>

<P>
Ford executives claim it will be a true pickup truck designed for commercial work. The truck is a competitor to the much-advertised Tesla Cybertruck, and shares similar specs on size, range, and towing capacity.

<P>
Designed and built to anchor Ford's projected $42 billion truck market, this vehicle will cost from $40,000 to $90,000 with top end options. It's powered by two electric motors and a battery pack instead of a traditional gas engine. It will be offered in two battery options with targeted ranges of 230 miles or 300 miles. It's all about progress toward a zero-emissions, digitally connected future.
</P>

<P>
A fascinating feature of the F-150 involves an at-home charger and an inverter that would automatically draw power from the truck when it’s plugged in -- enough to power an entire home or critical products during a power outage.
</P>

<P>
The question in my mind is if the truck can supply electric power during an outage, why couldn't it do so whenever, and wherever, it is parked? Let that sink in---a mobile electric generator, that when combined with other electric vehicles, comprises a modular power station. This could start with trucks and rapidly progress to cars and other vehicles. Imagine cars that sit in a company or private parking lot all day, generating clean electricity for use locally. How might this change the utility paradigm?
