<H1>The Big Four Engineering Disciplines</H1>

<P>
Prism magazine, the flagship publication for the ASEE [American Society of Engineering Educators] disclosed in the January 2020 issue some interesting engineering statistics. The total number of engineers in the U.S. in 2019 was 2,019,300, and broken down in this way:

<TABLE>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
  <TD>Electrical / Electronics            
  <TD>Civil
  <TD>Mechanical
  <TD>Industrial
</TR>

<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
  <TD>330,400            
  <TD>326,800
  <TD>312,900
  <TD>284,600
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Of course there are many other engineering disciplines as well, probably in total over 100 identifiable disciplines; but these above are the big four disciplines. Let's look at the projections for 2028.
