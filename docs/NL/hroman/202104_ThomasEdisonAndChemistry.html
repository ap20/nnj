<H1>Thomas Edison and Chemistry</H1>

<P>
I have been an Edison groupie since I was 10, and currently, that was 62 years ago. I lecture about him at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, NJ and serve as an educational author and advisor for the Edison Innovation Foundation in Newark. Sure, I know lots of cool stuff about Edison, things that never fail to grab the attention of the folks I talk to, or the readers of my articles and books. Yes, I know chemistry was his favorite science, but until I read a fascinating book about him recently, I had no real comprehension of just how deep his chemistry knowledge went.

The name of the book, which you might want to look into, is "Thomas Edison, Chemist", by Byron M. Vanderbuilt, published by the American Chemical Society, 1971. You may not find this in bookstores, but a good technical library in a corporation will probably have it. I found my copy on the Internet by visiting the used book sites and such.

Did that volume ever open my eyes not only about Edison's involvement with the science, but what was going on in the world of chemistry during the great inventor's time. Following an introductory chapter on Edison as a boy and his emerging interest in chemistry, the book examines his big areas of research and discovery, exploring how chemistry played a key role in each. The areas discussed are Edison's work in:

Frankly, I had no idea so much chemistry was involved in these fields, especially for a man with scant formal education. No wonder he studied so much... in itself, a remarkable feat and a terrific reminder about how important continuing education is. I recall a giant in the electrical engineering field, Reginald Fessenden, who worked for Edison for a brief time in the late 1880's. Edison promptly put this soon to be famous EE to work developing wire coatings (and other technologies) for the electrical power industry being developed. That work would be part of the "Chemistry of the light bulb and accessories" area quoted above - the accessories part is the operative term; for without the accessories, the light bulb would have been a curiosity. The power had to be gotten to the light bulb via generators, wires, cables switches and such. As an interesting note, by 1890, Fessenden was promoted to chief chemist for Edison, another sterling example of continuing education while on-the-job.

Another aspect that got me thinking was the development of phenolic resin - based plastics and Bakelite chemistry for phonograph records. This is quite involved chemistry that had many offshoots to other areas. The book also suggests that Edison's massive iron ore processing facility stimulated Henry Ford to consider the automation processes he would later use at his incredible River Rouge auto manufacturing facility.

So much interesting information stuffed into this book. Give it a read to appreciate how interconnected industry was and still is today!
