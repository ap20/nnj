<H1>Experiment Advances Fusion Energy</H1>

<P>
For well over 70 years scientists and engineers have been trying to make fusion energy a reality. Where nuclear fission is the splitting of heavy atoms (uranium) to make electricity, nuclear fusion is the combining of light atoms to make even more energy available. Fusion is the process that powers the stars, including our own sun-without the nasty brew of waste that results from nuclear fission.

On December 12, 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL), the first fusion reaction on Earth was demonstrated. Using 192 lasers carefully targeted upon a fuel pellet to produce more energy than was consumed in making the reaction happen-what scientists call a net gain of energy - they accomplished it without any production of carbon dioxide.  Most fusion efforts use the two heavy versions of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, as the fuel source, the so-called fuel pellet.

<P>
This experimental success will ultimately lead to a very clean new energy option, probably in the next 20-30 years, as engineers design and pilot test the first prototype power stations to use this process.

<P>
Yes, this experiment was a very big deal indeed!
