<H1>The 4 C's of the Global Economy</H1>

<P>
If I may, I should like to enumerate what I think are the 4 C's of the global economy; and here they are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Creativity
<LI> Curiosity
<LI> Collaboration
<LI> Communication
</UL>

<P>
Companies with a keen eye toward globally competitive activities will see the importance of having employees who embrace these key elements of success.
</P>

<P>
As many companies are now becoming aware, it is not simply about having smart employees who know lots of things, but rather what those smart people can do with what they know, to make the company more successful. And might I add, how fast they can do those things before the competition beats them to the punch.
</P>

<P>
Witness how many key companies are no longer interested in grades when young folks interview for jobs. They are much more interested in what potential new hires have done in the past--most pointedly, what stories can they tell about the things they did, and what were the economic results. This is the key to getting attention and being hired. It's the same for employees who have to re-bid their positions within their own companies. Tell them what you did, why you did it, and what were the economic benefits to the company--short and sweet--and tell a goodly number of those stories.
</P>

<P>
Putting the personal success stories in context with the 4 C's above shows how motivated a person is, their self-actualization, in solving problems. The first two, creativity and curiosity, at first glance seem a bit amorphous, fuzzy, and not easy to get one's hands around. But they are the very stuff of motivation, the spark that ignites interest--which fuses personal interest with company needs, a special kind of high-quality motivation. Collaboration is the willingness and ability to work together, the team thing. Of course, communication is about documentation of results and the ability to convince the world of ideas, ultimately, the selling of new ideas.

Incidentally, students taking STEM classes in school are using the 4C's all the time....so maybe we should call STEM the "school to work paradigm".

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
