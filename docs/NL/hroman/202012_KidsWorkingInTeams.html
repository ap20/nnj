<H1>Kids Working in Teams</H1>

<P>
Reflecting on the many days kids were denied the ability to work together in school because of the COVID-19 crisis, I remember a lesson I learned a few years ago at a local elementary school......with 5th graders in fact.
</P>

<P>
I often visit this particular school, and on this occasion I challenged three separate classrooms to work in teams to develop a game of their own design. These gifted and talented classes certainly rose to the opportunity to do this unstructured design challenge. After the teams finished their designs, we played the games in class.
</P>

<P>
Some games were traditional board games with very interesting twists and strategies, while others contained kinetic components to score points. What was certain was student involvement and excitement in designing and constructing the games, along with a description of the rules for playing the games.
</P>

<P>
I also did something different with the classes. I asked them to tell me what it meant to them to work in teams. Here is what they expressed after a week of working together:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>-Really enjoyed the team atmosphere
<LI>-Could see one another's ideas within the finished game
<LI>-Felt like they learned more about their classmates by doing this project, thus becoming better friends; and making new friends
<LI>-Surprised at how creative their team mates were
<LI>-Enjoyed the socialization as much as designing the game
<LI>-Want to do more of this type of project/challenge
<LI>-Excited to see their ideas come to life
<LI>-Felt good to be allowed to be creative
</UL>

<P>
Think the big kids at work feel the same enthusiasm about teamwork? If not, maybe we should figure out ways to make that happen!
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
