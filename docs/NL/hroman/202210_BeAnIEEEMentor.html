<H1>Be an IEEE Mentor</H1>

<P>
As you advance in age, you naturally look back, remembering how you got where you are -- also remembering the people that helped you get there.

In my 36-years at PSEG, the big constant in my career was IEEE mentorship. My colleagues were IEEE Fellows and Senior Members. All young engineers were encouraged to become members, and to get involved in various societies and volunteer positions. Leaders liked to see us write papers every 1-2 years; and get valuable experience in presenting them at the big NYC winter power engineering society meetings.  I also remember quite vividly, chairing photovoltaic paper sessions in NYC as well.

My seminal IEEE thrill came when I was asked by one of my mentors to assume a position as a volunteer leader in developing IEEE continuing education products for members. Talk about a learning experience! I worked with terrific IEEE staff in Piscataway and met very talented national IEEE members who put together some fascinating educational products. It was a fabulous experience. More recently, IEEE-USA asked me to develop professional and educational E-Books for members. I have been writing and publishing many of these little books, as well as numerous articles before that. This experience is so exciting for me, to be able to see my works in colorful print, and have members purchase and use these low cost, 20-page volumes.

When I attend our annual No. Jersey section awards celebration in May, I cannot help but reminisce about my long IEEE membership-and I must add, I think about IEEE colleagues who have passed. Joining IEEE and participating in its many activities has been such a bright star in my professional career. Be an IEEE mentor and volunteer. You will make a difference!
