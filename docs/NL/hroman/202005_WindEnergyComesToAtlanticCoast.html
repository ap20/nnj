<H1>Wind Energy Comes to Atlantic Coast</H1>

<P>
Over the next decade or so, from Long Island to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the surface of the Atlantic Ocean will sprout tall and massive wind machines. Together these machines, gathered into wind farms, will generate in total about 6,000 MW or 6 GW of power. By way of comparison, a typical nuclear power reactor can generate 1100 MW.
</P>

<P>
While most onshore wind speeds are low, speeds do increase and become more steady 3 miles off the coast. For instance, in New Jersey, onshore wind speeds are typically only 6-8 miles per hour with some selected shoreline locations exhibiting speeds of perhaps 10-13 miles per hour....but such speeds may be intermittent. Three miles off the coast, wind speeds blow almost steady at 16 miles per hour, making wind energy an economic power generation option.
</P>

<P>
It will certainly be challenging to get offshore wind generated electricity back to shore and integrated with the existing power grid. One popular theme a few years ago advocated developing an offshore high voltage "spinal cord" that many wind farms could essentially connect to; and that spinal cord would in turn connect to strategic on-land stations.
</P>

<P>
Let's take a look at the specific size of a possible offshore wind machine, and for this we shall refer to the GE 12 MW Haliade-X machine. Each blade is longer than a football field, with a total rotor diameter of 722 feet [220 m]. Keep in mind that while city blocks vary in length around the U.S., a length of 600-800 feet is not unusual in older established towns and cities. Imagine your block rotating in the air! Just to put this in perspective, modern day aircraft carriers are typically 1,000 feet in length.
</P>

<P>
The area swept out by the rotor blades is equivalent to 7 football fields....truly gigantic. Those football fields all together occupy 9.2 acres. Again....the useful comparison to an aircraft carrier, whose flight deck is on the order of 4.5 acres-so the total rotor swept area of a Haliade-X wind turbine is twice the area of a modern aircraft carrier!
</P>

<P>
The total height of the turbine assembly to water line is 853 feet, or 3 times the total height of the famous Flatiron Building in lower New York City; and approaching the height of the Chrysler Building and the Eiffel Tower.
</P>

<P>
No doubt, offshore wind turbines will work, but there will be significant challenges to get the power to shore reliably, and to maintain and operate the machines. We shall see where this is all going soon.

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
