<H1>Nuclear Power - A Carbon Dioxide Reduction Strategy</H1>

<P>
It was the 1960s and 70s and electric load in the U.S. was growing at a projected 7% a year -- meaning the electric generating station output for the nation would need to double about every 10 years. They were very heady times. The Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s further pushed electric utilities toward reducing the use of foreign oil; and this of course would help air pollution and smog as well. This was long before "carbon" was a bad word. Coal and nuclear were the twin pillars of a stable, embargo-free, solid fuel economy, for electric power production ... and would remain so into the 1990's.

Below is a table of the electric energy consumption for a typical NJ home during the volatile decades of rapid electrification, justifying a move to the energy intensive nuclear power option. Notice the huge increases in energy use every decade from the 1940's thru the 1970's (and then use dropped off as energy efficiency regulations began kicking in). How to meet those huge increases ?

Consider that oil could yield about 17,000-22,000 Btu of energy per pound of oil product used, whereas a pound of nuclear fuel could yield 30,000,000,000 Btu ... a huge amount of thermal energy; making it economic to build 2,000 MW twin nuclear reactors on the same site, with refueling needed only every 12-18 months. The choice was obvious in the 1970's and 1980's; and as a result oil use by the Nation's electric utilities was radically reduced.

<P>
Today, most states have gone on record to be largely or solely solar powered [for electric energy use] by about mid-century ... an interesting goal ... of which only time will tell if it's possible. Many middle-of-the-road energy advocates will argue this is totally politically motivated, with trouble waiting just down the road as solar energy advocates learn what the utility industry learned 100+ years ago. There is a big difference between energy and power; and battery storage may not be enough to make a real difference.
</P>

<P>
However, there is another fly in the ointment. Today, subsidies to promote solar-electric energy use have made it difficult for existing nuclear plants to remain economically viable. Yet, the carbon avoidance of a nuclear plant is enormous, overwhelming anything that solar today and in the foreseeable future can accomplish. Shutting down nuclear plants would be a huge step backward in the carbon removal strategy of the environmental movement, setting the movement back decades.
</P>

<P>
So that is where the nuclear power controversy stands today. There are some advanced designs being tried and modular reactors also being tested. It will be interesting to see where the Nation goes in its pursuit of aggressive carbon reduction. Be assured ... there will be interesting arguments from both sides!
