<H1>Our IEEE World</H1>

<P>
As I hear the ugly animosities and shouted claims of bias and bigotry nationwide in the news, I am reminded of pleasant IEEE section meetings. From our section podium I have often had the pleasure of gazing out at the beauty of many skin tones, hearing the pleasant accents of different cultures, enjoying the good- nature ribbing of colleagues, experienced gentle corrections from the audience, and the warmth of fellow professionals discussing different ideas. Our international salad of IEEE members get along just fine, why can't the nation at large?
</P>

<P>
Perhaps it is because we elevate our discussions to rigorous displays of reasoning and logic. We are not divided by emotional and subjective claims and counterclaims that neither can be proven nor resolved.
</P>

<P>
I like my IEEE world so much better. Why cannot the rest of the nation adopt our patterns of reasoning? I am very upset about all the visible and all too often violent demonstrations. I do not believe I am alone in my frustrations.
</P>

<P>
Perhaps the world should know more about how engineers conduct themselves professionally, already in step with a kinder, gentler nation, as I remember a past president once opining.
</P>

<P>
The world often calls engineers geeks and nerds, supposedly void of humanistic education. I doubt this characterization very much. Anyone is welcome to join in our discussions, which only requires good reasoning and logical analysis. We could care less about skin color or other physical cues. It is the presentation and robust nature of ideas that excite us. Why doesn't this work for the rest of society?
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
