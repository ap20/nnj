<H1>Looking Back - the Ford Model T</H1>

<P>
At the Thomas Edison garage, I often lecture about his 1922 Model T there. Visitors often ask how we got where we are with gasoline vehicles today. The Model T was produced from 1908 to 1927, with 15 million units manufactured and sold. In the early 1920's, Ford's Model T could be purchased for about $300. Gasoline was about $.25 a gallon. An electric vehicle of that time would have cost close to $3,000. The economic choice was obvious, aided by the ubiquitous availability of gasoline, even at rural general stores equipped with hand-cranked pumps. Some key facts:

<UL>
<LI> The engine was an in-line, four-cylinder, with a 177 cubic inch piston displacement
<LI> It could run on gasoline, kerosene, or alcohol
<LI> The car was notoriously difficult to drive (and sometimes start)
<LI> The Model T's throttle was operated by hand. The firing of the spark plugs was also controlled by hand. The driver had to operate both while driving - The engine generated 20-30 horsepower and propelled the car to modest top speeds of 40-45 miles per hour
<LI> The 10-gallon fuel tank was located under the front seat, giving the car a fuel economy of about 13-21 miles per gallon
<LI> Ford's Model T was the Tesla of its day. The Model T was so successful that Ford ran few advertisements, depending upon word of mouth to drive sales
<LI> The vehicle also became famous for its most popular nickname - the "Tin Lizzie"
<LI> For all practical purposes, the Model T was America's first SUV, capable of off-road maneuverability!

All Model Ts were built with a permanently affixed jack stand on the rear axle. This would allow the owner to remove the rear wheel and place a flat belt on the hub. The car could then be used to power farm equipment. This was factory standard on all Model Ts, right up to the 15 millionth produced in 1927.

The Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of vanadium steel alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of materials engineering, and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.

<P>
In the early 1900s, 40% of the cars on the road were electric, 40% were steam, and 20% were gasoline. The Model T and its successors changed all that. Today, there are over 280 million cars on the road with about 1% of them being electric. Changing the car fleet over to total electric will take several generations at best; and probably a re-do of the electric utility system; and many new charging stations. Not going to happen overnight or by wishing it so.
