<H1>R & D Labs—Edison’s Greatest Invention</H1>

<P>
What industry invested over $525 billion last year... any educated guesses?
That was the total amount of money spent on U.S. R & D in business, government
and academia combined.
</P>

<P>
Here are approximate U.S. R & D expenditures for the last 5 years:

<LI> 2013  $454 billion </LI>
<LI> 2014  $475 billion </LI>
<LI> 2015  $495 billion </LI>
<LI> 2016  $510 billion </LI>
<LI> 2017  $527 billion </LI>

The U. S. forecast for 2018 is $553 billion. <BR>
Global R & D investments are forecasted at $2.190 trillion. <BR>

Edison's greatest accomplishment was his invention factory concept [R & D labs],
using inter-disciplinary project teams solving problems in a multi-dimensional
manner. In essence, he took R & D from a cottage industry to a commercial powerhouse, thus giving us our modern conception of technology driven change,
or progress.

Between 1885 and 1929, many of the great American companies we recognize 
today, started their R & D centers and departments, helping to unleash a torrent of new products, services and of course patents:

These companies learned how to consider research as an investment akin to
stocks and bonds; and created research portfolios to govern how their 
companies would spread the risk of invention from the simple evolutionary
or incremental kind to revolutionary research that would create whole new
industries and concepts.
</P>

<P>
Business learned the lessons of Edison well, and the world profited. Think of
the validation for the great inventor. By the time he died in 1931, just about
all of the nation's great companies built R & D labs or developed partnerships to
perform R & D. Edison had codified the keys to team-based, technology driven
progress --- a process that by its very existence defines the term innovation
(innovation = invention + market thrust).

<P>
As a 37-year veteran of the R & D wars, I like to think of R & D as
"technological due diligence", very similar to traditional due diligence that
business entities perform to reduce the uncertainties of an acquisition... reducing it to acceptable risk. I have come to realize that 
when one performs R & D, it reduces the risk of technological acquisition or
development... hence R & D is technological due diligence, with a somewhat long
time delay. R & D converts uncertainty to risk.
