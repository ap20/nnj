<H1>What Advice Would You Give?</H1>

<P>
Here is an exercise to get your juices flowing. You are invited back to your alma mater to sit on an advisory board to provide input into its engineering college. You have been out of school for quite some time, but you have amassed a great deal of real-life engineering experience, the kind of "rubber-meets-the road" practical experience. What kinds of recommendations would you make for how the engineering curriculum should be taught?
</P>

<P>
As you look back over the years, what were the pitfalls you faced or the big surprises that caused career detours or opportunities? Is it possible young engineers could face similar circumstances? Could your advice help future engineers?
</P>

<P>
Would you be an advocate for new and improved subject matter, or perhaps better techniques and processes that students could use? Maybe both?
</P>

<P>
Should engineering students be encouraged to work part-time or during the summer for a company in an "engineering-assistant" capacity to learn first-hand about the work-a-day world of engineering? Should their college coordinate this?
</P>

<P>
How about professional skills like communications, and interpersonal skills? How did mastery of these skills affect your career? Should young engineers write and speak more to get ready for the business world?
</P>

<P>
Is there a place in the curriculum for the teaching of creativity and invention techniques?
</P>
<P>
What about continuing education and professional engineering affiliations?
</P>
<P>
What was the best advice your on-the-job mentors and colleagues ever gave you?
</P>
<P>
Why would you recommend IEEE membership? What benefits could this supply to young engineers?
</P>

<P> Talk to you again soon... </P>
