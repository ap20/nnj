<H1>That Texas Thing</H1>

<P>
How would you like to be involved with the aftermath of the recent Texas winter disaster, and having to hammer out a path for the utilities to follow in the future? Talk about a political ax fight! Can you envision all the finger pointing and turf protecting that is about to happen?
</P>

It always seemed right to have a wide diversity of energy resources on hand to provide a robust energy future. Determining how much of any one kind of energy source should be installed to ensure reliability standards is important. There are maximum penetration levels for a given utility or region. It never seemed right to this old utility planner to go totally renewable.

Many years ago, the mid 1980's as my aging brain cells recall, I was involved in looking at how much solar and wind energy would be tolerable in a mature, well-interconnected utility grid. Our team arrived at a level of 5-10% penetration to maintain reliability standards. Certainly, these numbers would vary a bit between different load mixes, generation types available and what not; but to simply replace everything with renewables is not prudent-more political than pragmatic. Imagine how much worse the TX problem would have been with no conventional energy sources!

The kicker here is once upon a time, America was dependent upon renewables like burning wood, a few scattered windmills and such. The emergence of managed electric power grids and multiple energy sources and natural gas pipelines made life that much more bearable. Do we want to go back to pre-modern energy systems, and be at the mercy of the vagaries of the weather? I think not.

Choose wisely Texas, the nation, and world, are watching. Massive amounts of batteries to back-up a total wind/solar future is not the right answer either. Take the time to get this right!
