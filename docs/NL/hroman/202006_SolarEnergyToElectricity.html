<H1>Solar Energy to Electricity</H1>

<P>
When folks find out I did a great deal of early work in solar energy back in the 1970's, 80's and 90's, there are always the inevitable questions about how much energy can a solar system  produce today.  Let's start with a simple 1 kW DC rated roof-mounted array, sitting in the NJ sunshine for a whole year. Using some rough rules of thumb and a quick and dirty analysis, I would project that little array would put out 1300 kWh AC annually. Since most home solar arrays are 3-4 kW in size, just do the multiplication from this 1 kW "unit array" to get the larger array's yearly energy output.

Typical NJ weather conditions could easily vary the annual energy output by 10-20%; but should we experience a big world volcanic eruption like that of Mt. St. Helens [1980] or Mt. Pinatubo [1991], annual solar energy values could dip 25-30% or more. And of course under normal weather patterns, the sunshine across the US and world does vary. To get a feel for this normal variation, let's move that 1 kW unit solar array of ours around the country. Here below are some values for the solar energy collection around some big cities:
