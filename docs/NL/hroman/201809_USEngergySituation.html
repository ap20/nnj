<H1>The United States Energy Situation</H1>

<P>
Undoubtedly we all have heard pronouncements about how states are trying to set goals for a more diversified energy economy. Often such discussions gravitate around increased use of alternate/renewable energy options.  Many states and their utility regulatory organizations want to have solar/wind technologies contributing 50% or more of their electrical energy needs—usually quoting target dates ranging from 2025 to 2050.
</P>

<P>
These are challenging goals, often entailing big assumptions and incentives for installing alternate/renewable systems. Historical experience indicates it can take 30-60 years or more to significantly change the energy economy.
</P>

<P>
Below are two tables about our nation’s energy mix you might find interesting. Draw your own conclusions about whether those lofty alternate/renewable goals are achievable.
