<H1>Remembering Reddy Kilowatt - the electrical servant</H1>

<P>
Reddy Kilowatt's charm and magnetism made him a household name across America for six decades. But now, the retired energy company mascot is mostly a memory and object of eBay auctions. Reddy was created in 1926 when Ashton B. Collins Sr. of Alabama Power saw a bolt of lightning that looked like a little man. Collins drew a spunky caricature that became an adored symbol of electricity to children and adults.

His cartoon-like image was everywhere electricity and electrical appliances were advertised or promoted. Today Reddy Kilowatt is owned and licensed by Xcel Energy. And although only a handful of companies still use Reddy Kilowatt in their marketing, the almost 100-year-old is still a popular character among the people who remember him. Lamps, clocks, war bonds, cuff links and light switch covers featuring Reddy Kilowatt's image are available on eBay. This lovable image has managed to remain current, making appearances in Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest.

In the 1940's famed illustrator Walter Lantz [of the Woody Woodpecker cartoon animations] and his talented staff gave Reddy a modern look, with a variety of facial expressions. By the 1960's about 300 utility companies purchased licenses to use the image. Some short films featured Reddy; and a song about him also was composed. Many public service pamphlets and booklets were purchased by utility companies for distribution to schools and civic / fraternal organizations. I often distributed them when I gave public lectures during my 36 years at PSE&G.

By the 1960's / 1970's, Reddy transformed from his promotion of electricity to a sponsor of environmental stewardship and energy conservation, showing the image of a servant planting seedlings and installing energy efficient lighting ... quite a change. I have a 1950's plastic version of Reddy, standing atop an electric outlet cover, resting not far from where I am writing this article. Prior to its current position, it was on my office desk at PSE&G for many years. My model glows in the dark-most appropriate, don't you think.
