<H1>Why Not an Energy Mix?</H1>

<P>
Here is our current energy mix, expressed as prime energy consumption by source for 2020 [source: U.S. EIA].  Petroleum-35%,  Natural Gas-34%,  Coal-10%,  Nuclear-9%,  Renewables-12%.
</P>

<P>
Of the 12% renewables portion; approximately 22% is hydroelectric, 26% is wind, 11% is solar, 39% is biomass, and 2% is geothermal.
</P>

<P>
Steeping back to 2005, the energy mix looked like this: Petroleum-40%, Natural Gas-22%, Coal-23%, Nuclear-8%, Renewables 7%. 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Energy Information Administration [U.S. EIA] baseline forecast projects that overall US energy consumption will increase by approximately 17 per cent between 2020 and 2050 because of increasing population and economic growth. Driven by incentives and falling technology costs, U.S. EIA forecasts the share of solar and to a lesser extent wind will increase from about 5 per cent in 2020 to 13 per cent in 2050.  Meanwhile, the share of petroleum and natural gas will remain flat at 36 and 34 per cent, respectively, or a combined 70 per cent of total energy consumption in 2050. It would appear, oil and gas will retain the lion's share status of the energy mix for at least the next 30 years. However, keep in mind these projections reflect "only existing climate law" and assume no changes to current policy moving forward.

<P>
We have always had diversity in our energy sources in the past, so why not into the future? Yes, we do use lots of oil and gas; but its value, to national security, and to our economy is well known - and we have ample reserves of the resources. Getting rid of oil and gas and stridently pushing for sun and wind to replace it does not seem to have diversity uppermost in mind. Why must the energy source arguments be either this or that in nature? Why not a strategic mix of energy sources? 
</P>

<P>
My long-time studies, of the energy history of the U.S., indicates it takes decades to make significant changes in the energy sources being used in our energy mix. We must be patient. Political edicts over serious discussions and debates can only lead to regrets later!
