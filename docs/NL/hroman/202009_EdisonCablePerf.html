<H1>Edison Cable Gives Great Performance</H1>

<P>
When Edison inaugurated the Pearl Street central station in NYC in 1882, it featured underground cables to deliver the DC electrical output to nearby customers; and these cables premiered his famous 3-wire system. Later, when he built his legendary West Orange R&D complex, his prototyping factory was powered using that 3-wire system generated from an on-site coal-fired power station. In fact, a visitor can see the defunct wires running along the factory ceiling, especially on the second floor.

Edison wired his house [Glenmont] for electricity in 1887/88 and powered it with an approximate 1 mile long cable from his power plant, adjacent to the factory, leading directly to the house. This cable terminated in the basement of the home, and embodied that 3-wire configuration---which can be seen here in the <A HREF="202009_EdisonCablePic.jpg">photo</A>. Excellent service was delivered by the cable from about 1888 until the house was converted to AC in the late 1950s when the National Park Service acquired the factory and home as a gift from the Edison family.

The biggest load in the house was for lighting, as the house boasted 500 light bulbs to illuminate the large 29 1/2 room Queen Anne Victorian mansion. Various wooden distribution boxes [containing many circuits, featuring both "hot and cold" wire fuses and a manual disconnect switch for each circuit] were located at strategic locations in the basement to feed circuits throughout the home. These can still be seen in the basement of the home, but are no longer functional.

Prior to the conversion to electricity, the home was illuminated with gas vapors distributed around the house with individual turn-offs that were lighted and extinguished individually. That gas was made on site, and in this case, it came from gasoline feedstock--talk about dangerous! Substantial homes like the Edison mansion, isolated from then developing urban manufactured gas distribution systems, employed what was known at the time as a Springfield Gas Machine system, that worked off a reservoir of about 400 gallons of gasoline located underground about 200 feet from the house with its warmed vapors vacuumed into the house for use. Electric lighting sure sounded a whole lot safer and cleaner.

The original light bulbs used were made to produce the same amount of light as candle flames so humans would already be receptive to the light level, and so be likely to want electricity, which left no residue on wall paper, ceilings, and furniture fabrics, and of course be much less prone to fire.
