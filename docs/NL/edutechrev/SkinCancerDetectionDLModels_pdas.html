<h1>AI-Driven Skin Cancer Detection: Enhancing Accuracy with
Deep Learning Models </h1>

<P>
Skin cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadliest disease conditions worldwide,
emphasizing the need for early and accurate diagnosis. In this work, we have explored the use of
deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), hybrid models, and
ensemble methods, for automated skin lesion classification. Preprocessing steps, including image
resizing, hair removal, contrast enhancement, and lesion cropping, were applied to improve
model accuracy. We have utilized the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset
for our work and compared the performance of deep learning models such as Simple CNN,
Hybrid CNN-RNN, Ensemble models, and SVM classifiers, achieving a maximum test accuracy
of 83.48% with SVM.

<P>
Despite advancements, challenges such as data imbalance, imaging inconsistencies, and model
interpretability persist. Ensemble techniques demonstrate robustness by leveraging strengths
across multiple architectures, while explainable AI tools like Grad-CAM enhance trust by
providing visual insights into model predictions. Future work aims to address ethical concerns,
expand datasets, and optimize computational efficiency to ensure reliable deployment in clinical
settings.
