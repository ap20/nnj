<h1>ML Applications on IT Incidents Management</h1>

<P>
Effective IT incident management is crucial for minimizing 
downtime and ensuring the reliability of IT services in today’s 
fast-paced technological environment. This project explores the 
application of machine learning techniques to enhance incident 
management processes. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
incidents are categorized with improved accuracy, enabling faster 
and more efficient resolution. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are 
employed to predict incident priority, ensuring critical issues 
are addressed promptly. Additionally, time series analysis is 
utilized to forecast incident trends, allowing organizations to 
allocate resources proactively and mitigate potential disruptions. 
The results demonstrate that integrating machine learning into IT 
incident management can streamline operations, optimize response times, 
and improve service quality. This project underscores the transformative 
potential of AI-driven solutions in IT service management, paving the 
way for more resilient and efficient IT operations.
