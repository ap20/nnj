</h1>

<p>
The presentation covers the essentials of testing electrical power equipment.  
It talks about commissioning and maintenance testing of such systems 
and references resources, standards, regulations and authorities on the topic.  
It further covers different philosophical approaches to maintenance testing.  
Finally, it covers components of the electrical distribution system from 
transformers to panelboards to circuit breakers and the cables between.

This presentation was offered for the Engineers Joint Committee of Long Island
by Ronald Quade, who can be reached at: rwquade@ieee.org.  It is broken into 
two parts.  The first part covers testing, standards, training, equipment used,
switchboards and transformers.  The second part covers circuit breakers, cables, 
batteries, relays, grounding systems and motors.
