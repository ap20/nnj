<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning - Part 2: Classification</h1>

<P>
The theme of this article is to introduce machine learning algorithms to address
the set of classification problems.  Logistic regression is used in the
prediction of target variable values.  The use of classifier versions of KNN,
Decision Trees and Random Forests are applied as well to compare performance.
Cross validation with multiple data subsets is used to produce higher quality
results.  Confusion matrix and classification reports are used to summarize.

<P>
Additional algorithms of a different variety of classifiers are examined.  These
include Adaboost and XGBoost.  They are introduced to compare alternate ensemble
methods to train models and make classification predictions on the same dataset.
Alternate regressor implementations can be applied to regression problems as well
and used in predicting continuous valued target variables.
