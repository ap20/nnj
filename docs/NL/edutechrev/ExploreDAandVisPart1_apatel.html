<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization Part 1</h1>

<P>
This article covers a number of important aspects of working with data. Specifically issues around data's statistical properties, its cleanliness, its completeness and its visualization. A handful of techniques related to using tools to manage the data are described, rooted in Anaconda Navigator's JupyterLab notebooks.  Details about using the Python programming language ecosystem tailored for data science and demonstrating commonly used libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and others. 

The article will provide exposure to a swath of ideas in a logical progression. Some of the mentioned packages will be demonstrated in either analyzing data from a variety of sources or drawing different graph types to show aspects of the plotted data and results obtained from the analysis.  Additionally, some of the built-in library functionality for gathering statistics about the data will be reviewed and also how to manipulate Pandas dataframes by changing, reducing and augmenting the stored data for study.
