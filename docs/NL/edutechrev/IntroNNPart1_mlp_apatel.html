<h1>Introduction to Neural Networks - Part 1 : Multilayer Perceptron
</h1>

<P>
The theme of this article is to introduce a new category of machine learning
algorithms known as neural networks.  The process of using neural
network algorithms for training models and using them for prediction remains
the same as earlier machine learning examples.  Neural networks introduces
different approaches to managing an algorithm for training purposes.  They
also introduce different architectures (input, hidden and output layers)
for neural network construction that play a roll in how effective the
neural network is at prediction.

<P>
New and distinct datasets are used in this review to demonstrate
the performance of the models on this data amongst the neural networks used.
Some exploratory data analysis is used to assess how to clean and prepare the
data prior to its use in training models.  The statistical properties
of the dataset informs the approaches to be used in data hygiene.  These
dataset cover fertility and census income corpi.

<P>
To evaluate performance and tune hyperparameters, some error metrics are
used to summarize and improve the prediction capabilities.  Training time
is also explored for the neural network.  Additional areas covering
convergence, feature engineering, and the basic operation of the multilayer
perceptron is demonstrated using the scikit-learn libraries.
