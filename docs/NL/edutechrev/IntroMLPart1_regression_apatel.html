<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning - Part 1: Regression</h1>

<P>
The theme of this article is to introduce machine learning algorithms to address
the class of regression problems.  Linear regression methods are used in the
prediction of target variable values.  Problems with overfitting the training
data and regularlization methods to overcome these problems are discussed.
The idea of cross validation with multiple data subsets is used
to produce higher quality results.
<P>
Additional algorithms outside of linear regression are examined.  These include
k-nearest neighbors, decision trees and random forests.  The regressor versions
of these algorithms can be used to train a model for making similar predictions.
These algorithms have parameters that can be optimized in the process known as
hyperparameter tuning.  A few techniques of searching for the parameter values
are examined and their effect on creating the best model.
