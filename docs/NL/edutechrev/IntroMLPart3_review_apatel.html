<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms - Part 3 : Review on New Datasets
</h1>

<P>
The theme of this article is to review the machine learning algorithms
discussed in previous articles.  These supervised learning algorithms
function on both regression and classification problems.  Linear regression,
Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting are all demonstrated.

<P>
A number of new and distinct datasets are used in this review to demonstrate
the performance of the models on this data amongst the algorithms used.
Also, rudimentary exploratory data analysis is used to assess how to clean the
data prior to its use in training models.  The exercises evaluate what can
be removed or how missing data can be treated based on statistical properties
of the dataset.  This better informs the approaches to be used in data hygiene.

<P>
To compare performance, error metrics like, mean absolute error, confusion
matrix and classification reports are used to summarize the prediction
capabilities.  In order to see comparative performance, one particular
dataset is used across a number of algorithms to produce outcomes.
