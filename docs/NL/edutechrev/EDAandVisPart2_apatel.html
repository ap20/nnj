<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization Part 2</h1>

<P>
This article demonstrates exploratory data analysis and visualization for a set
of well known datasets.  The purpose of the article is to show the reader the
different techniques that can be utilized to examine, clean, and prepare the
data for consumption by model algorithms.  This can include fixing missing
values or removing un-needed data.
<P>
Fundamental to understanding the data is reducing the many features available
to just the relevant ones that can contribute best to training the model.
Principal component analysis and data reduction algorithms like k-Means-Clustering
help to extract features or synthetically create more impactful ones to use in a model.
Visualizing the data can be one very good way to understand the dataset.
Scatter, pairwise plots, heatmaps, and descriptive statistics can help present
it to others for explanatory data analysis.
